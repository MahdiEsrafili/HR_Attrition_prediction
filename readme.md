## Human Resources Analysis for Attrition of Personels

In this repo I analyzed a dataset for attrtion of personels and created a machine learning model. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is fictional dataset. <br>
the files:
* HR_talent_management.ipynb: the main code and notebook. If you want to know what algorithms I used, how EDA done, How pipelines created, check this file.
* ModifiedLabelEncoder.py: Is a class for encoding categorical features.
* flask_app.py: The backend and frontend code for entering parameters and making prediction for Attrtion.
* le_pipe.joblib and model_pipe.joblib: trained pipelines for encoding categorical features and selected ML model.
* predict_notebook.ipynb: a notebook for check results (not important).
* data directory contains some datasets that are good for HR analysis, but here I just used WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv .
